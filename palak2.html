        Our undergrads have <span class="highlight">flown to Singapore to install software they designed for the Nobel
          Museum, built their own SMS-based commodity exchange to help farmers in Ghana, and more</span>.
        They know what it's like to hear a professor say this about an undergrad teaching assistant:
        "I feel like I can absolutely treat her as a peer."

        Other colleges are dealing with growing interest in CS by capping the number of students who can major in it.
        Weâ€™ve never done that: instead of turning applicants away, we've planned to keep growing, putting in place new
        programs to help first-generation and low-income students.

        Department provide undergraduate and graduate degree programs, preparing students for careers in various
        computing fields.
        This includes developing software, designing systems, and applying computer science principles to solve real
        world problems.
